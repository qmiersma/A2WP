WHEN INTEGRATING API (FINAL PRODUCT): 
- Enable Application Passwords on the sbvpa and dreamcenter prod sites
- Change env variables SBVPA_PASS and DREAMCENTER_PASS to the new app passwords

MOVING FILES TO REMOTE REPO PLAN: 
- Nonce will no longer be needed, use app passes for everything
- functions.php needs to enqueue a remote script (different url)
- Make new azure project because other one's name is funky
- POST url can't be hardcoded, have env hold different values for different sites (app pass, post url)
- call-a2wp will be separate file for each site (dreamcenter-a2wp, sbvpa-a2wp)
- Make checkExists exist in class so it doesn't have to be repeated, just make sure it's first in line before other customFuncs
- slug window.location var needs to grab from origin because otherwise it'll get the proxy url

EDGE CASES 
- What if amObj returns nothing once checked (no new activities)

REBUILD
NOTES: 
You will never push to amilia, so that's only a POST endpoint
wp endpoint is also mainly for POST, and when using GET it's getting items 
from where you'd be posting

Using the application pass assumes the user is named appsadmin



createFunc function? That acts kind of like enqueue scripts? 
 Pushes function name to global class array, then executed in call
 Returned information moves into next function (can I add another parameter to a function already made?)    

For delete
Make async function that adds to newAmObj and oldWpObj
Compare if amItem already exists in wpObj
Compare if wpItem exists but corresponding amItem doesn't
 loop amObj
     loop wpObj
         amId == wpAmId ? break (no need to delete or make)
         if wpAmId, exists = wpAmId
      if amId != exists (if break, they should be same, so wont reach past this)
         if wpAmId = "" the entire time (exists[wp => ""]), push to newAmObj
         if wpAmId != "" (exists[wp => "${id}"]), push to oldWpObj
NOTE: This won't work for deleting because it needs to be WP looping through Amilia, and doing for index loops wont work because both objs WON'T be the same length
NOTE: Eventually move checkExists to class? Once I figure out the query thing

loop amObj
    loop wpObj
        amId == wpAmId ? exists = true, break
        if !exists push to newAmObj

loop wpObj
    loop amObj 
        wpAmId == amId ? exists = true, break
        if !exists push to oldWpObj
